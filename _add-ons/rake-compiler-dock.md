## Rake Compiler Dock

Create fat binary gems with native C extensions for all supported Ruby versions for Windows and Linux.
This is a companion gem to [rake-compiler](http://github.com/rake-compiler/rake-compiler/) which provides a Docker based cross compiler environment to build the extension against different Ruby versions.
