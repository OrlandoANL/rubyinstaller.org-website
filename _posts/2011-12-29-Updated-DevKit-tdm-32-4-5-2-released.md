An updated version of DevKit-tdm-32-4.5.2 has been released and is available from the [downloads](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) page. Enjoy!
This version includes an updated version of the <code>dk.rb</code> installation script that better handles the DevKit's
installation directory search behavior and fixes [GH #80](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/issues/80)
