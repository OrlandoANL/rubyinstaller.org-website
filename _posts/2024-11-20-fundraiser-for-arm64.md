title:  "RubyInstaller for ARM64"

The RubyInstaller for Windows on ARM is an entry that has been on my backlog for a longer time.
But I still miss a device with an ARM processor other than a Raspberry PI.
After several attempts to get Windows 11 properly working on this device, I give up with this low budget hardware for this purpose.
It needs a more powerful and stable system.

If you want to support me to build and maintain the Windows on ARM64 version of RubyInstaller, you can make a donation on the [fundraiser I started](https://www.gofundme.com/f/port-and-maintain-rubyinstaller-for-windows-on-arm64).
If the goal of 1200â‚¬ is reached, I'll buy a Windows notebook with the new snapdragon processor.
With the proper hardware in place it is only a question of weeks to make the RubyInstaller fit for ARM.
All the hard [work on ruby core](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/8995) is already done, MSYS2 is [available for ARM64](https://www.msys2.org/wiki/arm64/) and InnoSetup supports ARM64 already.

Here is the link to the fundraising campaign:
